## JavaScript Quiz App

A simple JavaScript Quiz app that I made in React to test one's JS knowledge. Currently working on the basics including functions, loops, conditionals, objects and will add more advanced topics including OOPs, promises, higher order functions, closures, async/await, etc.

## Issues:

- Either fetch the data from local variable or use the data from the local storage (json file) to display the data
- ~~use useReducer to manage the state of the application (number of questions, total correct answers, total wrong answers, current question number, etc)~~
- Bird animation needs a reduced duration in mobile view along with adjustment to end time position.
- Overall UI setup for responsive view (mobile and tablet view)

### Installation

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Jaycelab/Quiz-App.git` \
Navigate to the project directory: `cd quiz-app` \
Install dependencies: `npm install` \
Start the app: `npm start`
