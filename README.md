# Quiz App

## Issues:

- Either fetch the data from local variable or use the data from the local storage (json file) to display the data
- ~~use useReducer to manage the state of the application (number of questions, total correct answers, total wrong answers, current question number, etc)~~
- Bird animation needs a reduced duration in mobile view along with adjustment to end time position.
- Overall UI setup for responsive view (mobile and tablet view)
